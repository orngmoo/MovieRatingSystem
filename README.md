# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Rating System (MRS)

## Description  
The **Movie Rating System (MRS)** is an interactive Java application that allows administrators and users to manage and interact with a movie database. Admins can add, update, or delete movies, while users can search for movies, rate them, leave comments, and like comments. This project demonstrates core programming concepts, such as object-oriented design, input validation, and interactive menu-driven systems.
